Evaluating a Neural Network For Identifying Between Malicious and Benign Software. 

The research aim of the project is to create and evaluate a neural network model and classifier that will try and accurately classify a random software sample as either benign or malicious. It shall then be evaluated to see if artificial intelligence could replace more conventional anti-malware methods.

This project shows that static-analysis can be used to create a fairly accurate classifier ~95% accurate according to the dataset used. 

However, this is not conclusive enough evidence that this static-analysis model should be the final result, a more accurate classifier using both static and dynamic analysis neural networks
would provide the best outcome of data. This is because a program cannot be known to be malware until it has been executed hence why using both will provide the best outcome.

Training set, Testing set and VirtualEnviorment setup are not included. 

1. Ensure Python 2.7.1, tensorflow 1.13, openCV, numpy, sklearn, os, glob, sys, argparse, array, PIL is installed

2. To train the model, make sure the datasets you want used are in the correct directories
python train.py 

3. To convert a single file from a file to an image, use convert_single.py [arg]
python convert_single.py [arg]

4. To classify/predict whether the file is benign or malicious
python predict.py [arg]

5. To view results on TensorBoard
TensorBoard --logdir [path to directory (in the train.py file it is automatically set) of logs]
